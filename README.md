# Web-Dev-Events-and-Effects
This repo contains some more events and effects. This time with jQuery and along with HTML, CSS and Js. 

## Effects
I have showcased Fade out, Fade in effects using jQuery. The text color fades away or comes back upon the click on specific buttons.

## Looping-Day Night mode
The main thing i did in this was how looping is achieved in Js. Moreover I have provided the functionality of changing to dark mode and again light mode by clcik events. 

## Sliding Effect
I have showcased how slinding effects are produced in the frontends of many web sites.
